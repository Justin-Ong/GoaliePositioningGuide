# Goalie Positioning Guide for Omega Strikers VOD Review
A simple [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) model trained to detect the core and draw a line from your goal to the core. Useful when reviewing VODs to check your defaulting position.

## Why use an AI for this?
Because I can.

## What limitations are there?
I trained this on 1920x1080 footage, and different resolutions will impact the accuracy of the core detection. Also, because I only draw from the goal to the core, this does not help check your positioning when defending barriers.

## Can I use this in-game?
Technically yes. However, I do not recommend it because firstly, it may be considered cheating, secondly, you might sabotage yourself because of the distraction. Also, depending on your keybinds you might accidentally bring the overlay into focus instead of the game, eating your inputs.

## Future plans?
Might add tracking of teammates and opponents to draw areas of influence? Also maybe detect goal barriers too.
